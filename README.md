# 🎯 Austen's VS Code Configuration

> My personal VS Code Insiders configuration - where the magic happens ✨

This repository contains my VS Code user configuration, including custom Copilot instructions, MCP server integrations, and settings that power my day-to-day development experience.

## 🤖 Copilot Customization

The `prompts/` directory is packed with custom instructions and AI agents that supercharge GitHub Copilot:

* [📋 Instructions Files (`.instructions.md`)](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aaustenstone%2F.vscode%20path%3A*.instructions.md&type=code)
* [AI Agents (`.agent.md`)](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aaustenstone%2F.vscode%20path%3A*.agent.md&type=code)
* [Prompts (`.prompt.md`)](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aaustenstone%2F.vscode%20path%3A*.prompt.md&type=code)
* [Toolsets (`.toolsets.jsonc`)](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aaustenstone%2F.vscode%20path%3A*.toolsets.jsonc&type=code)

## 🔌 MCP Server Configuration

The [mcp.json](./mcp.json) file integrates multiple Model Context Protocol servers for extended capabilities
