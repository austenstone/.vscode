Browser-based interactive 3D Three-Body problem simulator 

Features include:
  - Several preset periodic orbits: the classic Figure-8, plus newly discovered 3D solutions from Li and Liao's recent database of 10,000+ orbits (https://arxiv.org/html/2508.08568v1)
  - Full 3D camera controls (rotate/pan/zoom) with body-following mode
  - Force and velocity vector visualization
  - Timeline scrubbing to explore the full orbital period
  
The 3D presets are particularly interesting. Try "O₂(1.2)" or "Piano O₆(0.6)" from the Load Presets menu to see configurations where bodies weave in and out of the orbital plane. Most browser simulators I've seen have been 2D.
Built with Three.js. Open to suggestions for additional presets or features!
