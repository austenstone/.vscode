This prompt is designed to instruct an AI to act as a codebase analyst, researching a specific repository to automatically generate a tailored `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file.

# Information

## Types of custom instructions

### .github/copilot-instructions.md file
* Describe code-generation instructions in Markdown.
* All instructions are combined in a single file, stored within the workspace.
* Instructions are automatically included in every chat request.
* Supported across all editors and IDEs that support Copilot.
* Use this file to define general coding practices, preferred technologies, and project requirements that apply to all code-generation tasks.

### Writing effective repository custom instructions
The instructions you add to the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file should be short, self-contained statements provide Copilot with relevant information to help it work in this repository.

You should also consider the size and complexity of your repository. The following types of instructions may work for a small repository with only a few contributors, but for a large and diverse repository, these may cause problems:
* Requests to refer to external resources when formulating a response
* Instructions to answer in a particular style
* Requests to always respond with a certain level of detail

### ACTIVATE: COPILOT INSTRUCTIONS GENERATOR

## Core Directive

Your primary function is to analyze a specified GitHub repository, understand its structure, technologies, and conventions, and then generate a comprehensive `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file based on your findings.

## Output Generation

After completing your analysis, synthesize your findings into a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file. The output must be a single markdown block.
* Use the information you gathered to fill out each section of the template below.
* Be concise and direct. Copilot works best with clear, rule-based instructions.

### Generated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` template

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**"
---
```

### Example 1: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` basic

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**"
---
We use Bazel for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven, so when talking about Java packages, always give me instructions and code samples that use Bazel.

We always write JavaScript with double quotes and tabs for indentation, so when your responses include JavaScript code, please follow those conventions.

Our team uses Jira for tracking items of work.
```

### Example 2: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` general coding guidelines

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**"
---
# Project general coding standards

## Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, interfaces, and type aliases
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Prefix private class members with underscore (_)
- Use ALL_CAPS for constants

## Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for async operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Always log errors with contextual information
```

### Example 3: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` TypeScript and React coding guidelines
Notice how these instructions reference the general coding guidelines file. You can separate the instructions into multiple files to keep them organized and focused on specific topics.

```markdown
---
applyTo: "**/*.ts,**/*.tsx"
---
# Project coding standards for TypeScript and React

Apply the [general coding guidelines](./general-coding.instructions.md) to all code.

## TypeScript Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow functional programming principles where possible
- Use interfaces for data structures and type definitions
- Prefer immutable data (const, readonly)
- Use optional chaining (?.) and nullish coalescing (??) operators

## React Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow the React hooks rules (no conditional hooks)
- Use React.FC type for components with children
- Keep components small and focused
- Use CSS modules for component styling
