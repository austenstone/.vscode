Help me cleanup this project. Break the work into pieces that can easily be divided up amongst workers.
* Do general code review and point out bugs and issues in the codebase
* Look for security vulnerabilities
* Implement testing and fix tests
* Implement linting and linting fixes
* Ensure docs are up to date
* Implement CI/CD
* etc.
